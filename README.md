# MEOW
File compressor (that is zip in disguise) that compresses into .MEOW and decompresses them.



# How to use?

You probably need to do 'pip install PIL' first so the logo can render and 'pip install requests' so it can fetch the latest updates (It's probably already preinstalled with Python but it doesn't hurt to check.)

Grab a copy from the Releases and launch the exe or if you downloaded the source, launch the main.py.

Do stuff.



# Features

It can check for updates, custom settings for compression, and a fancy logo.
